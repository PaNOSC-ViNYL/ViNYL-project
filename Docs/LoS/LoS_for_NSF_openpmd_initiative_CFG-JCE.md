# Letter of Support

To whom it may concern

We, the signatories, hereby express our support for the proposal by Dr. Axel Huebl and coworkers in response
to the NSF call for proposals for opensource ecosystems.

### Dr. Carsten Fortmann-Grote

Carsten was a scientist for scientific simulations at Eu.XFEL from 2015 to 2019. He is currently
the workpackage leader in work package 5 "Virtual Neutron and X-ray Laboratory - ViNYL" in the EU Horizon 2020
project "Photon and Neutron Open Science Cloud - PaNOSC". Carsten  also heads the Scientific Computing Unit at the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl√∂n, Germany. Carsten has a strong background in theoretical
x-ray plasma physics, x-ray plasma diagnostics, and many body physics and he is a
research software developer with experience in both industry and research settings.
Carsten authored or co-authored numerous theoretical
and experimental research papers and regularly serves as a peer reviewer for various high profile academic journals.
Carsten is furthermore the initiator and, until recently,
main developer of the open source photon science simulation library SIMEX. Today,
Carsten is takes an active role in various
European and German research data initiatives.
His current main research interests are stochastic simulations of
biological systems, application of machine learning in life science and physics and the creation of knowledge
graphs through semantic web technologies and- Linked Data.

## How we have contributed to openPMD

OpenPMD has become the backbone for most
data formats and data descriptors in SIMEX. Over the last years, openPMD has also
been adopted in other, complementary photon
and neutron simulation frameworks within the ViNYL project. The central API library **libpyvinyl**
implements a Data class which supports conversion of native data formats into openPMD compatible hierarchical
data formats. In ViNYL, we have developed
various domain extensions e.g. for molecular dynamics data, for neutron and photon raytracing data, and for
wavefront propagation data, some of which have become part of the official openpmd extensions.

## Why we support the proposal

"Glueing together" various simulation codes, SIMEX and ViNYL
greatly benefit from open data and metadata standards. Consequentially, we strongly support the continued
maintenance and further development of the openPMD ecosystem as well as the establishment of strong links with
the plasma physics community. We believe that the large field of plasma physics will greatly benefit from
such an overarching collaboration. Enabling data to flow seamlessly 
between the typical software applications for simulations, data analysis, and visualization in the various
areas of plasma physics, e.g.
magnetohydrodynamics, atomic and molecular physics (electronic structure simulations, MD simulations),
plasma diagnostics (spectroscopy, scattering) will greatly facilitate new opportunities for data driven
cross areas research.

## How we will contribute

Carsten offers to share his expertise and experience in various domains in and beyond plasma physics through
more or less formalized ways. He will gladly serve and participate in advisory boards, reviews or discussions.
