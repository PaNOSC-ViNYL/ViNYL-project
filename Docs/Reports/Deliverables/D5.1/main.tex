\section{Introduction}
Standardized formatting and hierarchical organization of simulation data and associated metadata is paramount to support seamless
exchange of data between simulation software in simulation pipelines and to benefit from 3rd party data visualization
and analysis software that support these formats. By applying the openPMD metadata standard for particle and mesh data \cite{Huebl2015} to all simulated data in
WP5, our workflows and results become accessible, inter--operable, and reusable, i.e. in line with the core concepts of
FAIR Data Principles \cite{Wilkinson2016}.

This report details the metadata standard extensions for simulation data developed in Work Package 5 (WP5) of the Photon
and Neutron Open Science Cloud (PaNOSC). The openPMD standard in its current version 1.1 is the basis on which we have
developed domain specific extensions for the simulation stages of start--to--end photon and neutron experiment
simulations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Coherent wavefront propagation (simulation of coherent lightsources and beam transport)
  \item Photon raytracing (simulation of x--ray optical beamline components, incoherent sources)
  \item Neutron raytracing (simulation of neutron beamlines)
  \item Molecular dynamics simulations (target simulations, radiation--matter interaction)
\end{enumerate}

All extensions are deposited under the WP5 github project at \url{https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/openPMD-standard} in
the branch ``upcoming-2.0'' in fulfillment of the project deliverable D5.1 of PaNOSC. To expose our standard extensions
to the wider community, we will propose to merge them into the base standard repository
\url{https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard} after the Deliverable has been accepted.

\section{The openPMD base standard}
OpenPMD stands for open particle and mesh data and was initially developed as a metadata and data hierarchy standard for
particle--in--cell (PIC) simulations of high--power laser--matter interaction at the Helmholtz--Zentrum Dresden--Rossendorf.
Due to its flexibility (allowing for adaptation and adjustments for other applications than PIC), independence from the
actual file format (supporting e.g. hdf5 \cite{HDFGroup1997}, netCDF \cite{Rew1989}, adios \cite{Liu2014} and json
\cite{json2019} and
more), and being maintained by an active open source community, the openPMD standard is widely adopted in numerous
simulation codes, visualization codes, and simulation workflow platforms.

The base standard structures simulation data by the following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Series: The root object of the data hierarchy.
  \item Iteration: Simulation time step (the time stamp of a given simulation snapshot)
  \item Particle  or mesh
  \item Type of particle (e.g. electron, proton) or mesh (e.g. electric field, magnetic field).
  \item Records (Physical variables):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For particles: Position and momentum (velocity) vector components
      \item For meshes: Field values (components for vector fields)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
In addition, the standard defines a number of mandatory and optional metadata information to define and specify the
physical meaning of the data. E.g. for particle data, each record must provide information about the physical unit in
which its data is written. A mesh must provide the grid spacing, dimensionality, extension, and geometry and, where
appropriate, the corresponding units. An iteration must provide which physical time it corresponds to. Further metadata
about the code that produced the data, the data author, the time and date of the simulation, the version of the standard
that this data was formatted against, are provided as attributes of the Series.

\section{OpenPMD extensions}

\subsection{Wavefront data}
Coherent wavefront propagation plays an import role in the simulation of coherent light sources, such as free--electron
lasers. Applications include studying the intensity and phase distributions at the experimental interaction point and
effects of misalignments, pointing errors, fluctuations in the temporal, spatial, and spectral pulse structure on the
latter.

During a wavefront simulation, the horizontal and vertical polarization components of the complex electric field is calculated at a given position in the path of the light
pulse in three dimensions: horizontal and vertical position in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis and time. From
this data, all observables such as intensity, phase, polarization, divergence, pointing, energy spectrum and other, can
be calculated. The information is complete in the sense, that the propagation can be continued further down the
beamline from a simulation that stopped at an upstream position. The temporal sampling resolves the slowly varying pulse
envelope but not every single oscillation of the the laser fundamental frequency.

The electric field components as defined above are the required data records for the wavefront domain extension.
Besides, the standard requires information about the radius of curvature in horizontal and in vertical direction, its
standard deviation, as well as the standard photon energy to be given as attributes of the Series. Furthermore, it must
be specified whether the data represents the pulse in the time or in the frequency domain, and in the cartesian, or in
the reciprocal space.

This domain extension can be found at \url{https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/openPMD-standard/blob/upcoming-2.0.0/EXT_WAVEFRONT.md}.
An example dataset is published on zenodo at \url{https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3524710}
\cite{Fortmann-Grote:zenodo2019}.

Example python code how to write and read can be found in the python simulation library SimEx,
\url{https://github.com/eucall-software/simex_platform/blob/openpmd/Sources/python/SimEx/Utilities/wpg_to_opmd.py}.

\subsection{Raytracing data}
\subsubsection{Neutrons}
The field of neutron scattering relies heavily on Monte Carlo raytracing simulations for design of instrumentation. The low 
brilliance of neutron sources means that larger beams are required to achieve the necessary intensity, and thus the point 
approximations used in most analytical calculations are inadequate. Raytracing simulations provides a phase-space description 
of the neutron beam at the sample position, but it is also possible to do virtual experiments that include the sample physics 
resulting in expected intensity on the detector.

In Monte Carlo raytracing simulations a large number of random initial neutron states are generated from realistic random 
distributions or loaded from a file. The neutron state includes position, velocity, polarization, weight and time. The 
physical unit of the weight is neutrons/s, as the expected intensity of the source is split into the total weight of simulated 
rays. These rays are propagated through an instrument, and the neutron weights are lowered to account for  absorption or 
reflectivity losses. The weights can also be manipulated to provide variance reduction, for example by focusing all scattering 
towards the detector and reducing the weight with the appropriate factor based on the solid angle of the detector. The 
intensity expected in a pixel of a detector is then the sum of the weights of neutrons that arrived in that pixel. 

The openPMD extension for neutron raytracing simulations contains the necessary fields for describing neutron state, 
facilitating transfer of neutron rays between different simulation tools. The different simulation packages include different 
capabilities, and thus it can be useful to switch from one package to another to get the highest accuracy possible.

The proposed domain extension for neutron scattering can be found at \url{https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/openPMD-standard/blob/domex_neutron_raytracing/EXT_NRAYTRACING.md}.
An example mock data set is published on Zenodo along with the code used to generate the dataset \cite{Bertelsen:zenodo2019}.

\subsection{Molecular Dynamics data}
Molecular dynamics (MD) is a long--established computer simulation method to analyze atom/molecular movements by solving Newton's
equations of motion assuming a given potential energy function. It is broadly used in statistical physics, physical chemistry,
structural biology, material science, and crystallography. As many researches in above disciplines are largely dependent
on advanced light sources like synchrotron and free--electron lasers, MD simulation becomes an important tool to predict the 
results of the experiments conducted in these large light source facilities.

With MD simulation, the structural evolution of the experimental sample can be modeled. Depending on the computing power, the time scale 
of the model can range from fs to ns, and the length scale can be up to several hundreds nms. The fact that the scales are 
just right close the the experimental scales and the atomic-level simulation solution make it possible to calculate 
scattering signals from the MD atomic configuration which is comparable with the experimental sample. This kind of simulations has already
been used in the researches of deformation under high pressure\cite{kimminau2008jpcm,tang2017jap,tang2018jsr,zhang2019jsr}, 
crystallization \cite{e2015}, and crystallography \cite{coleman2013msmse} to predict diffraction patterns for experimental design
and interpretation.

Not only the event that people want to explore in experiment, but also the interaction between sample and incident X--ray can be considered
in MD simulations. Radiation damage induced by high--intensity X-ray is assumed to be one of the limiting factors
for achieving subnanometer X-ray imaging of single particles\cite{caleman2011acsn}. With MD simulation codes considering ionization
process like GROMACS\cite{lindahl2001} and XMDYN\cite{jurek2016}, the effects of radiation damage on the reconstruction resolution
of single particle imaging can be investigated.

The necessary output of MD simulation is the coordinate of each atom for each atom species in the sample structure. Besides that, the velocity of each atom, 
the simulation box and the force fields implemented should be recorded if a restart of previous simulation is asked for.

This domain extension can be found at \url{https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/openPMD-standard/blob/upcoming-2.0.0/EXT_MD.md}.
An example dataset is published on zenodo at \url{https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3525951}
\cite{Juncheng:zenodo2019}.

Example python code to convert the output of XMDYN to comply the MD domain extension can be found here
