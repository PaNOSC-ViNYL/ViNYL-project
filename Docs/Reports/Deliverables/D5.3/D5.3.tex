\section{Simulation infrastructure}
Deliverable D5.3 in PaNOSC is the release of jupyter notebooks and Oasys
workspaces
that demonstrate the utilization of simulation services in appropriate cloud
services, i.e. jupyter hub instances or cloud based Oasys installations,
respectively. This document lists the published notebooks and workspaces and
gives a brief outline of their scientific content as well as instructions how to
launch them.

This Deliverable is accompagnied by Milestone MS5.3, the release of the
simulation API library \textit{libpyvinyl}. \textit{libpyvinyl}
ensures a common interface for
simulations that choose to build upon this foundation. In addition, we built
a instrument database to represent beamline and instrument components in neutron
or x--ray RIs, their parameters and permissible parameter values.
Instruments can be easily retrieved from an
accompanying Python API, and expert users can update the instrument description
directly through github where we host the database. By hosting the instrument
database on github we ensure it is accessible to a broad user base without
specialized knowledge of database technology such as SQL and we avoid having to
implement and maintain web frontends. Another benefit is the
option to run quality checks on proposed updates of instruments using
Continuous Integration.

Our simulation services are backed by three distinct simulation frameworks:
Simex for x--ray laser experiments, Oasys for x--ray optics, mainly focussing on
synchrotron sources and McStasScript for neutron simulations. The underlying
simulation codes are described in the respective framework's documentation. In
the following, we document dedicated github repositories that host our jupyter
notebooks and workspaces.

\section{McStasScript notebooks}
\label{sec:mcstas}
The McStasScript notebook repository along with the code repository are shown below, along with a link to the online documentation.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
McStasScript code repo  & \url{https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/McStasScript} \\ 
McStasScript notebooks & \url{https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/McStasScript-notebooks} \\  
McStasScript documentation & \url{https://mads-bertelsen.github.io}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The McStasScript notebook repository currently contains a full 11 notebook
tutorial on McStas using the McStasScript Python interface developed under WP5.
This tutorial is also available through the online McStasScript documentation.
The repository also contains an example on using the widget interface for
McStasScript, and an example on using a cryostat construction tool included in
McStasScript.
